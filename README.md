# Weather app

A (not so) revolutionary app that receives the user's location and uses a weather API to inform the user when the best weather will be in the next 5 days for an outdoor activity such as a bike ride (based on temperature, wind and rain) - it will default to a 2 hour block but can be user defined (if I can figure out how). The user can select how many "nice weather blocks" to fetch for the week.
